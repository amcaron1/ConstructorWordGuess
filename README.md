# ConstructorWordGuess

- Overview
    - Randomly choses a movie name from an array
    - Creates a word object to store the movie name.  The word object creates letter objects to store the letters and a boolean that signals whether the letter has been guessed correctly
    - Creates a display word with underscores where the letters would be if the letter has not been guessed correctly and letters where it has been guessed correctly
    - Displays the display word and prompts the user to guess a letter
    - Gets the letter and compares it to letters in the movie name, changing the boolean if there is a match
    - Updates and displays a new display word and asks for anothter letter.
    - The game is over when the user correctly guesses all of the letters in the movie name or when 15 guesses have been made.
